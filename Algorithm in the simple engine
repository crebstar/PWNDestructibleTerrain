Algorithm in the simple engine
===============================

*** Steps for simple ground creation **
Important to note the current engine only has a working demo for iPhone Non Retina

1) A UIImage with the image used for the sprite is created and then added to the CCMutableTexture2D (Extends Texture 2D)
	Note :: Very important fact that CCMutableTexture2D does NOT extend CCNode

2) A CCSprite is then created with the factory method 'spriteWithTexture' accepting an instance of CCMutableTexture2D 
3) Each ground sprite image is 160 by 60 and is scaled to be 2x in order to simplify calculations and maintain a 60 FPS

4) The first ground sprite is rendered at the top and the rest built relatively off the one above it


*** Steps for collision detection ***
